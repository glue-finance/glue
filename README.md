# Glue V1

## Description

Glue V1 is a permissionless protocol that allows any ERC20 token or ERC721 Enumerable NFT to become a 'Sticky Token' by associating it with a unique Glue address. Once a token is 'sticky', any ERC20 tokens or ETH can be sent as collateral to its Glue address. Token holders can then burn their Sticky Tokens at any time to withdraw ('unglue') a proportional amount of the collateral assets stored in the Glue.


## Lore:

- üß¥ **Glue Stick**: is the factory contract that glues ERC20 or ERC721E tokens.
- üç• **Sticky Asset**: is an asset fueled by glue.
- üí¶ **Glue Address**: is the address of the glue that is linked to a Sticky Token.
- üí∞ **Glued Collaterals**: are the collateral glued to a Sticky Token (ERC20 and ETH).
- üîÑ **Apply the Glue**: is the action of infusing a token with glue, making it sticky by creating its Glue Address.
- üîÑ **Unglue**: is the action of burning the supply of a Sticky Token to withdraw the corresponding percentage of the collateral.
- üí∏ **Glued Loan** is the action of borrowing collateral from multiple glues.
- ü¶æ **Glued Hook** is a tool to expand the functionality of the protocol, via integrating the Sticky Asset Standard in your contract.
- üü¢ **Sticky Asset Standard** A common tools to implenet in your contract to expand the Glue functions and simplifying the development process.
- üëΩ **Sticky Asset Native** SAN is an asset that is natively compatible with the Sticky Asset Standard.

## Structure:

Glue V1 is composed of 6 smart contracts:

- [**GlueStickERC20**](https://github.com/glue-finance/glue/blob/main/contracts/GlueERC20.sol): is the factory contract that glues ERC20 tokens.
- **GlueStickERC721**: is the factory contract that glues ERC721E tokens.
- **GlueERC20**: is the contract that creates the Glue Address for a Sticky Token.
- **GlueERC721**: is the contract that creates the Glue Address for a Sticky Token.
- **GluedSettings**: is the contract that manages the settings of the protocol.
- **GluedMath**: is the library that contains the math functions used by the protocol.
- **StickyAsset.sol**: is a minimal abstract contract for Glue Protocol Native Assets integration

Glue V1 is composed of 7 interfaces:

- **IGlueStickERC20**: is the interface for the GlueStickERC20 contract.
- **IGlueStickERC721**: is the interface for the GlueStickERC721 contract.
- **IGlueERC20**: is the interface for the GlueERC20 contract.
- **IGlueERC721**: is the interface for the GlueERC721 contract.
- **IGluedSettings**: is the interface for the GluedSettings contract.
- **IGluedLoanReceiver**: is the interface for interacting with Glued Loans and Flash Loans from glues.
- **IGluedHooks**: is the interface that defines callback mechanisms for Sticky Assets to interact with the Glue Protocol.
- **IStickyAsset.sol**: is the xtension interface that defines callback mechanisms for Sticky Assets to interact with the Glue Protocol

## Deployments:

Glue V1 Smart Contracts are originally deployed and verified on:

- üî∑ **Ethereum Mainnet**
- üîπ **Ethereum Sepolia**
- üî¥ **Optimism Mainnet**
- üü• **Optimism Sepolia**
- üîµ **Base Mainnet**
- üü¶ **Base Sepolia**

We're working on deploying the contracts on more networks, you can check the updated deployments [here](https://todo.com).

The factory contract addresses remain consistent across all supported networks:

| Contract Name      | Address |
|--------------------|---------|
| GlueStickERC20     | 0x49fc990E2E293D5DeB1BC0902f680A3b526a6C60 |
| GlueStickERC721    | 0x049A5F502Fd740E004526fb74ef66b7a6615976B |
